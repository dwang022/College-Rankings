## Project Overview
College rankings play a pivotal role in determining where millions of students go to school each year, but which factors truly shape them? Our investigation will use data from the QS World University Rankings to find out. In this article, we’ll explore why some schools rank higher than others, how schools in different regions compare, and the differences between public and private universities. We’ll also see which schools rose and fell the most in the rankings since 2017 and examine UCLA’s strengths and weaknesses compared to its peers. We decided to use QS because their rankings provide a comprehensive look at universities across the world, not just in the U.S., and they utilize a robust and transparent methodology to score each school. For this article, we will limit our analysis to only the top 100 universities globally in 2024.
